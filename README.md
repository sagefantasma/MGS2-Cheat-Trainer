# MGS2-Cheat-Trainer
Just a simple Cheat Trainer C# VS Form for MGS2 on the Master Collection.

Be sure to check out the MGS3 Cheat Trainer created by @ANTIBigBoss over at https://github.com/ANTIBigBoss/MGS3-Cheat-Trainer-GUI ! I used his project to learn the basics of modding for this project, and so he gets all the credit for this one too :^)


## What can you do with the MGS2 Cheat Trainer?

You can give yourself any item your character can normally use, at any time, and at any quantity!

And, of course this also applies to weapons!

You can track your in-game stats live, in case you want to practice for a specific run!

Having a hard time with a specific boss? Or maybe you want to continue the fight but don't want to wait to reload a save? We got you.

WARNINGS:

May cause crashes if you perform "forbidden" actions, or if the game decides you've done something bad. We're doing our best to prevent as many crashes as possible, but there will always a risk of crashing no matter what due to the nature of this mod. Be warned and use at your own risk.

Known scenarios that cause crashes:
- Equipping a weapon that Snake/Raiden is not "programmed" to equip(only the USP.45 for Raiden. Most weapons besides M9, SOCOM, Grenade, Stun, Chaff, and Magazine for Snake). We have built-in checks to help try and prevent it, but can't promise it will be perfect.
- Giving Raiden ANY weapons before opening the bulkhead door in the Deep Sea Dock(as soon as you're out of the Codec with Campbell, you're good to give Raiden any weapon he can equip :^])(This _may_ only happen if you start a New Game on Plant only, but that is not certain)
