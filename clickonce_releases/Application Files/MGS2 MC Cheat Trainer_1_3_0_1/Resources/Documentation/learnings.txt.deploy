- having a `steam_appid.txt` file with the game's AppID as the contents will allow you to cut out the launcher entirely
- if you don't want to totally cut out the launcher(idk why you would want this), you can start the MGS process w/ `-jump directGameStart`(w/ MG1 or MG2 appended for those 'uns)

Values to make some cheats work
----------------------------------------------------
Regular cheats
  - Walk through walls: 39 = on, 36=off
  - Enable Stealth: 64 = invisible :not from cameras ='(]
 
Weapon values
 - If you want to disable weapons: set value to -1 or 65535
 - this also means for items.
 - Whitesnoop ~
Alert mode = Put 1
Evasion = just lock for infinite evation
Caution = 5000 or whatever number to get Caution

        /* 12/10: Interesting CE learnings -
         * 
         * Certain game stats are tracked GLOBALLY and reset on launch(kill count, shot count, holdups, choke outs, prolly more)
         * It looks like the memory accesses these counts AT LEAST once on game load, once on screen load and twice on gameplay
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * 12/23: More CE investigations - 
         * (all of these findings are based off of a NG, Hard file. need to confirm it is consistent across difficulties/NG state
         * Pullup count is stored -90 bytes from dynamic anchor
         * SnakeHasCold is stored -128 bytes: cannot be changed after snake has already used cold meds, can change before
         * Currently equipped weapon is -68 bytes
         * Currently equipped item is -130 bytes
         * Something related to sneezing is at -108(2bytes). Whenever snake sneezes, it changes to 2D 00, then changes to another value. maybe time for next sneeze?
         * -154 and -146 seem to be related to player position? unsure.
         * -134 seems to represent current stance(00 is standing, 01 is crouching, 02 is prone: not quite sure how to leverage these yet)
         * 
         * Things that might be interesting to find/mess around with:
         * 
         * - Can we change max health? On hard its set to 75, but i can't see _what_ is changing it
         * - Can we manually modify boss health?
         * - Are there any AOBs we can use to find static strings/values?
